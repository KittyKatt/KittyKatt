# hello world

My name is **Katie** and I go by *KittyKatt* or *itsk8ekat*. I currently work as DevOps Engineer.

A lot of my history in development has been in writing lengthy, complex, and far-overengineered BASH scripts. You can see a few them below.

Nowadays, I mostly work in Terraform/Helm/Kubernetes and making small changes to projects I personally use without really knowing the language they're written in.
